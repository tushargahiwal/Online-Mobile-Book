Project Setup
  - You just need to run npm install in both the frontend and backend directories. This will install all required modules.
  - Then, start the project using npm start for the frontend.
  - For the backend, use nodemon server.js or node server.js.
  - For admin registration, you need to register through Postman or Swagger.
       - Admin Credentials:
        {
          "firstname": "Tushar",
          "lastname": "Gahiwal",
          "email": "tushargahiwal55@gmail.com",
          "password": "tushar@123",
          "role": "admin"
        }

2.Testing
  - Validation checks for the registration and login pages.
  - Login page should work with valid credentials; if invalid, it should display an error.
  - Check if the product is booked successfully.
  - Ensure the product list displayed to the admin includes only the products they added.
  - Test product add, update, and delete functionalities.
  - In the admin dashboard, verify if the product and booking counts are displayed correctly.
